## Notes

Llama remains my daily model of choice for local LLM workloads. 

A use-case that I am constantly trying (and erroring) in is local system optimisation (and on remotes) - running a CLI for 

 
## Usage Patterns

- **Recent Activity**: Heavy usage of Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 models (modified within last 20 minutes)
- **Specialized Tasks**: DeepSeek R1 for reasoning, Nomic for embeddings, MythoMax for creative content
- **Resource Management**: Range from 1.3GB (Llama 3.2 1B) to 10GB (Qwen 2.5 14B) for different use cases
